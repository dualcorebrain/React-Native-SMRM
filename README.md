A mobile app that lets you easily read sheet music, by automatically zooming into the stave/staff and scrolling along as you play.
This project is written in React Native with Expo. For My Final Year PRoject


## Getting Started



## PROBLEMS

- Screen Orientation crashes giving Error 
- Android.manifest file solution doesnt work
- React-native doesnt support WebMIDI API
- JSON files reading much more difficult
- Plethora of other issues with MIDI inputs, tried to fix them for weeks yet only lead to a different issue...
- MIDI inputs sometimes do not register
- APP freezes randomly and rarely even causes BSOD on Android emulator
